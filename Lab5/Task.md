# Lab Assignment 5 : CSV Manipulation

Your task is to write a Python program that reads this CSV file, calculates the average score for
each student, and then creates a new CSV file named "student_average_grades.csv‚Äù

**Steps to Solve**
    1. Read the data from "student_grades.csv" using CSV file handling in Python.
    2. For each student, calculate their average score across all subjects (Maths, Science, and English).
    3. Create average functions to calculate the average for each student.
    4. Store the student's name and their corresponding average score in a new dictionary.
    5. Write the data from the dictionary into a new CSV file named "student_average_grades.csv" with two columns: "Name" and "Average."
